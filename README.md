**Develop, manage, and deploy efficient machine learning applications with Python**

### What is this book about?

FastAPI is a web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6 and its later versions based on standard Python-type hints. With this book, you’ll be able to create fast and reliable data science API backends using practical examples.

This book starts with the basics of the FastAPI framework and associated modern Python programming language concepts. You'll then be taken through all the aspects of the framework, including its powerful dependency injection system and how you can use it to communicate with databases, implement authentication and integrate machine learning models. Later, you’ll cover best practices relating to testing and deployment to run a high-quality and robust application. You’ll also be introduced to the extensive ecosystem of Python data science packages. As you progress, you’ll learn how to build data science applications in Python using FastAPI. The book also demonstrates how to develop fast and efficient machine learning prediction backends and test them to achieve the best performance. Finally, you’ll see how to implement a real-time face detection system using WebSockets and a web browser as a client.

By the end of this FastAPI book, you’ll have not only learned how to implement Python in data science projects but also how to maintain and design them to meet high programming standards with the help of FastAPI.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Explore the basics of modern Python and async I/O programming
* Get to grips with basic and advanced concepts of the FastAPI framework
* Implement a FastAPI dependency to efficiently run a machine learning model
* Integrate a simple face detection algorithm in a FastAPI backend
* Integrate common Python data science libraries in a web backend
* Deploy a performant and reliable web backend for a data science application
